# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
Project created an app in which beta testers could input statements to filter data for their weather preferences which were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
